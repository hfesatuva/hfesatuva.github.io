# Joining HFES at UVA

### Getting Involved

Many of the events on our [public calendar](/cal) are open to nonmembers. You can contact a member or fill out an [interest form](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwig4M78nfH2AhWlrHIEHbSeD8IQwqsBegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdQw4w9WgXcQ&usg=AOvVaw0aHtehaphMhOCAkCydRLZU) to learn more.

### Become a Member

Most of our members are HFES National members. You can learn more about joining on the [HFES website](https://www.hfes.org/membership). However, it is possible to join the local chapter even if you're not ready to become a National member.
